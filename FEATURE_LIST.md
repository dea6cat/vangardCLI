# VangardCLI Feature List & PR Roadmap

> Capability list, roadmap, and PR guide for community contributors.
>
> Project positioning: **a Python rewrite based on the real Claude Code source structure**. It already provides a usable multi-provider chat CLI, a complete tool system framework, and an Agent Loop, and is filling in the key capabilities of native Claude Code in phases.

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|------|------|
| ✅ Implemented | A verifiable implementation exists in the current repository |
| 🟡 Partial | A skeleton, mirror layer, or partial capability exists, but the loop is not yet complete |
| ⏳ Planned | Direction is defined; PRs welcome |
| 🚫 Not started | No implementation yet |

---

## Project Highlights

- **Python rewrite**: Not just a UI imitation, but a rebuild following Claude Code's architectural approach.
- **Multi-model first**: Currently supports three providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, and GLM.
- **Usable CLI / REPL**: Basic interaction already works and is ready for continued iteration.
- **Complete tool system framework**: 30+ tool modules, an Agent Loop, and a permission system framework are implemented.
- **Built for community collaboration**: The Python ecosystem is easier to extend, well suited to tooling, automation, and data engineering scenarios.
- **Emphasis on authenticity**: Prioritizes completing core paths that actually run, rather than just growing the list of command/tool names.

## Roadmap

## Phase 0: Launchable, installable, usable ✅

Goal: make the project smooth for new users and contributors first.

- [x] Decouple the CLI startup path; `--help`, `--version`, and `config` should not depend on provider SDKs
- [x] Lazy-import providers so local features remain browsable when an SDK is missing
- [x] Pin and verify a Python 3.11+ development environment
- [x] Improve installation instructions and a minimal runnable example
- [x] Clean up statements in the README that do not match the current implementation

## Phase 1: Claude Code core experience MVP ✅

Goal: reproduce the most important first layer of the native Claude Code experience.

- [x] Unify the chat REPL, slash commands, and session store
- [x] Complete the tool system framework
- [x] Implement the Agent Loop
- [x] Unify error handling, retry, and re-login flows
- [x] Complete transcript persistence and recovery infrastructure
- [x] Establish a stable set of user commands

## Phase 2: Real tool-call loop ✅

Goal: move from a "mirrored tool list" to a "truly executable Python agent".

- [x] FileReadTool
- [x] FileWriteTool
- [x] FileEditTool
- [x] BashTool
- [x] AskUserQuestionTool
- [x] TodoWriteTool
- [x] WebFetchTool / WebSearchTool
- [x] Tool schemas, parameter validation, exception handling, call logging
- [x] Tool execution result feedback loop

## Phase 3: Context, permissions, recovery (in progress)

Goal: fill in Claude Code's engineering capabilities.

- [ ] Complete workspace context building
- [x] Basic git status / file tree / `CLAUDE.md` injection
- [ ] README / entry file summary injection
- [ ] Memory and history context management
- [ ] Full permission system integration
- [ ] `/resume`
- [ ] `/compact`
- [ ] `/doctor`
- [ ] pre/post tool use hooks

## Phase 4: MCP, plugins, extension ecosystem

Goal: upgrade the project from a monolithic CLI to an extensible platform.

- [ ] Complete MCP client/runtime
- [ ] Python plugin system
- [ ] Custom commands / tools / hooks
- [ ] Local model and third-party provider extensions
- [ ] Better observability and debugging tools

## Phase 5: Distinctive strengths of the Python version

Goal: build features unique to the Python rewrite.

- [ ] Notebook-friendly toolchain
- [ ] Enhancements for data engineering / ETL scenarios
- [ ] First-class support for Chinese model providers (GLM, etc.)
- [ ] pytest / ruff / mypy / uv integration experience
- [ ] Extension interfaces for in-house enterprise automation and workflows

## PR Submission Tips

## Recommended Public Description

You can introduce the project like this:

> VangardCLI is a Python rewrite based on the real Claude Code source structure. It already provides a multi-provider chat CLI, a complete tool system framework (30+ tools), and an Agent Loop with a working tool-call loop, and is now improving context building, the permission system, session recovery, compaction, MCP, and the plugin system. PRs are welcome around tool enhancements, runtime, permissions, context, and Python-native extension capabilities.

## One-Line Summary

**We already have a Python Agent Runtime with a complete tool system framework and Agent Loop; next we will improve context building, permission integration, and recovery capabilities to turn it into a Python agent platform with the full Claude Code experience.**
